There are two branches: 

	- Master branch (Like the Production Branch):
		Only used for final development.
	- Development branch: 
		Where we are going to work the most of the time.
		You can create other branches that point to the development branch to solve
		issues temporarly.

For any other branch creation:
	1. Talk about it with the resposibles.
	2. Upload this file in order to have everything recorded.
